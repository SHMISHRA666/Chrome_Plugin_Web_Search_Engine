File | Photo Credit: The Hindu The BJP on Saturday (May 24, 2025) slammed Jairam Ramesh for his remarks on the NITI Aayog meeting , saying the Congress leader will finish off his party with his tendency to create controversy over some or other issues. \"This is a meeting of Team India to take decisions for the country's development. Jairam Ramesh is finding fault in this too,\" BJP national spokesperson Syed Shahnawaz Hussain said. Also Read | Three southern CMs skip PM-chaired NITI Ayog meet; Stalin, Revanth, Naidu in attendance Calling the NITI Aayog an \"Ayogya\" (unfit) body, Mr. Ramesh, Congress general secretary in-charge of communications, hit out at the Centre and alleged its meeting was yet another exercise in \"hypocrisy and diversion\". Reacting sharply, Mr. Hussain said the Congress leader keeps finding faults in every meeting convened by the government to create some controversy. \"Jairam Ramesh Congress ki Ram Ram kar ke hi chodenge (Jairam Ramesh will finish off the Congress),\" he told PTI Videos. The Congress leader's comments came as NITI Aayog's 10th Governing Council meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, began on Saturday. The theme of the meeting is 'Viksit Rajya for Viksit Bharat@2047'. The BJP spokesperson described NITI Aayog's meeting as \"Team India's meeting\" and assailed the Congress for objecting to it. \"NITI Aayog is a big institution of the country. It makes policies for the country. In its meeting, eminent people, including chief ministers, are sitting together to make the country develop. The Congress has started objecting to it also,\" Mr. Hussain said. The BJP leader also took a swipe at Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi over his visit to Jammu and Kashmir. \"'Bahut der kar di huzoor aate aate' (It took you a long time to visit),\" he said, reciting a couplet from a popular Hindi film song. The Indian Army has given such a befitting reply to Pakistan that it is still feeling the pain, he said. Mr. Gandhi on Saturday (May 24, 2025) met the victims of cross-border shelling by Pakistani troops in Jammu and Kashmir's Poonch and described the damage caused as a \"big tragedy\", pledging to highlight their plight at the national level. The Congress leader visited Poonch town and interacted for over an hour with the affected population, including the families who lost their members in the shelling between May 7 and May 10.

Snippet from the demo video Introduction to MCP In late-November 2024, Anthropic released Model Context Protocol (MCP) as an open standard for integration between LLMs and external systems. In Anthropic\u2019s words, MCP is a new standard for connecting AI assistants to the systems where data lives, including content repositories, business tools, and development environments. Anthropic is certainly not the first to introduce a connectivity framework for GenAI applications. However, they are the first that I\u2019ve encountered to offer one as a standard that is intended to be agnostic to the model provider. In contrast, we have a wild west framework ecosystem including langchain, llamaindex, and many others in conjunction with the exclusive SDKs from model providers such as OpenAI, Mistral AI, Anthropic, etc. I\u2019m personally very excited by the potential of one standard to rule them all and built an MCP Server for Gmail to learn more about it. MCP Architecture Primer At its core, MCP follows a client-server architecture wherein a MCP Host will serve as the primary program/application and offers the interface to an MCP Client. The MCP Client can be thought of as the primary LLM making decisions and orchestrating everything. The MCP Client interfaces with one or more MCP Servers, which are the external tools and systems to which the protocol offers a novel way to connect and communicate. Model Context Protocol architecture MCP Gmail Server Setup For those ready to dive right into creating an MCP Server for Gmail, here is the repo with Gmail API setup and usage with Claude Desktop. The server provides tools to retrieve, read, send, view, and remove emails. It uses Gmail\u2019s Python API, which requires some quick setup : Create a new Google Cloud project Enable the Gmail API Configure an OAuth consent screen Select \u201cexternal\u201d. However, we will not publish the app. Add your personal email address as a \u201cTest user\u201d. 4. Add OAuth scope https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail/modify 5. Create an OAuth Client ID for application type \u201cDesktop App\u201d 6. Download the JSON file of your client\u2019s OAuth keys 7. Rename the key file and save it to your local machine in a secure location. Take note of the location. The absolute path to this file will be passed as parameter --creds-file-path when the server is started. Using with Claude Desktop As of writing this article, MCP Hosts and Clients are rather few and far between and most early development has taken place on the MCP Server-side. For the purposes of this exercise, I will be using Claude Desktop as a fully capable MCP Host. We will connect Claude Desktop to our cloned Gmail server enabling one to manage their email directly from Claude Desktop. Once you\u2019ve downloaded Claude Desktop and your machine has uv , add the following to your Claude Desktop\u2019s configuration. By default, this is stored as ~/Library/Application\\ Support/Claude\\claude_desktop_config.json. { \"mcpServers\": { \"gmail\": { \"command\": \"uv\", \"args\": [ \"--directory\", \"[absolute-path-to-git-repo]\", \"run\", \"gmail\", \"--creds-file-path\", \"[absolute-path-to-credentials-file]\", \"--token-path\", \"[absolute-path-to-access-tokens-file]\" ] } } } The below arguments must be set. Gmail Server\u2019s required parameters --directory should be set to the location of the cloned git repo. Set --creds-file-path to the file location specified in step #7 above. Finally, set --token_path to a desired location for the server to write application access tokens for future use. Save claude_desktop_config.json and restart Claude Desktop. You should now see a little tools icon within the chat box in Claude Desktop. Checkout the full demo video ! Snippet from the demo video Final Thoughts Building this MCP Server for Gmail served as a great teaser to MCP. While this server is primarily a toy example, the obvious extensibility of the framework is enough to keep one up at night imagining new features.
